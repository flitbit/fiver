# fiver

An undersized, opinionated, RabbitMQ library for common messaging patterns in Nodejs.

Builds my preferred AMQP patterns on the ubiquitous [amqplib](http://www.squaremobius.net/amqp.node/channel_api.html#overview). Hopefully it is of some use to others.

## Getting Started

In your shell:

```bash
npm install fiver
```

In your module:

```ts
import { Broker } from ' fiver';
```
